# Project Roadmap

## Backend Development (FastAPI)

1. Setup FastAPI Project:
   - Initialize a new FastAPI project with basic configurations.

2. Database Configuration:
   - Set up MongoDB connection and define data models for courses, modules, lessons, steps, and users.

3. Authentication:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

4. API Endpoints:
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for:
     - Creating new courses
     - Listing existing courses
     - Viewing details of courses, modules, lessons, and steps
     - Updating courses
     - Deleting courses

5. Email Notification:

## Frontend Development (Vanilla JS & ES6)

1. Initial Setup:
   - Create the HTML, CSS, and JS structure for the app.

2. Client-Side Routing:
   - Implement hash-based client-side routing.

3. Core UI Components:
   - Develop core UI components based on your ASCII layouts for:
     - Homepage
     - My Courses Page
     - Create Course Page (Form and Chat)
     - Acknowledgment Page
     - Course, Module, Lesson, and Step Pages
     - AI Assistant
     - About Us Page

4. API Integration:
   - Use JavaScript fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to communicate with FastAPI backend.

5. Dynamic Rendering:
   - Implement JavaScript functions to dynamically render data fetched from the API.

6. State Management:
   - Implement client-side state management for the app.

7. PWA Features:
   - Service Worker:
     - Implement service worker for caching.
   - Manifest:
     - Create a manifest file for PWA metadata.

## Testing

1. Backend Testing:
   - Write unit tests for API endpoints.

2. Frontend Testing:
   - Implement browser testing for key user flows.

## Deployment

1. Backend Deployment:
   - Deploy FastAPI backend.

2. Frontend Deployment:
   - Deploy frontend files to a web server.

3. SSL Setup:
   - Ensure HTTPS for security.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

1. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure that the app is fully responsive.

2. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Communication with Cubit Server:
   - Integrate with Cubit Server for AI features (not part of this project but will be linked for AI functionalities).

Once we have this roadmap, we can proceed with implementation step-by-step. Would you like to begin with the backend or frontend first?
